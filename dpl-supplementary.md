## Abstract ##

In this file, we provide a detailed convergence analysis for the proposed DPL algorithm. We first introduce some related definitions of the bi-convex optimization problem [1, 2], and present the conclusions of the convergence of the alternative convex search (ACS) algorithm [3]. Then, we analyze the bi-convex property of our objective function, and show the equivalence between the ACS algorithm and our optimization algorithm.


## 1 Bi-convex problem and alternative convex search algorithm ##

We first introduce the basic definitions of bi-convex optimization problem, and then introduce the ACS algorithm used to solve it. The convergence of the ACS algorithm has been analyzed in [2].
